- Fix setToolTipText on MenuItem in Web.
- Show test URL in MainDev Web launch console.
- Make Dialog subclasses editable with Eclipse WindowBuilder.
- Re-enable crash trapping on Web version.
- Work on general-purpose property set/get that allows manipulating and saving any properties of an instance, via reflection. Should display in a grid.
- Work on keys for Data, based on natural keys. Don't use row numbers; that won't work as soon as a row is deleted.
