** TO DO **

- Re-enable crash trapping on Web version.
- Convert all dialogs to _not_ use readAndDispatch(), and instead use non-blocking interaction.
- Work on general-purpose property set/get that allows manipulating and saving any properties of an instance, via reflection. Should display in a grid.
- Work on keys for Data, based on natural keys. Don't use row numbers; that won't work as soon as a row is deleted.
