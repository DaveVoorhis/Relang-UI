Relang application development tool for Java that combines the agility of spreadsheets with the robust scalability of databases. We call the combination a _datasheet_, and Relang is the first of its kind.

It is a cross-platform desktop development environment for Windows, MacOS and Linux that will generate cross-platform applications for Windows, MacOS, Linux and the Web. There's also a Web-based server for hosting database access and Web-based multiuser applications. 

Relang in Mandarin Chinese (热浪) means "heat wave" in English.

This is _very_ much a work in progress.
