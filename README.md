Relang is a database-driven application development environment that combines the agility of spreadsheets with the robust scalability of databases. We call the combination a _datasheet_ and Relang is the first of its kind.

It is a cross-platform desktop development environment -- based on Java -- that runs under Windows, MacOS, and Linux. It generates cross-platform applications for Windows, MacOS, Linux, and the Web. There's a Web-based server for hosting database access and Web-based multiuser applications.

Relang in Mandarin Chinese (热浪) means "heat wave" in English.

This is _very_ much a work in progress.
