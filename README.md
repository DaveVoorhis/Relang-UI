Experimental work on a D -- tentatively named Relang -- that transpiles into Java.

If the experiment proves successful, Rel will eventually transpile Tutorial D into Relang.

Relang in Mandarin Chinese (热浪) apparently means "heat wave" in English... Perfect.

Requires ANTLR4 plugin for Eclipse. Update site is http://www.certiv.net/updates/ 
Only AntlrDT is required.
